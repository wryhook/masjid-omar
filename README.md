## Quick Start Guide

Before deploying your landing page to production, you can run your project locally to test any changes you'll make:

### Prerequisites

Before installing the dependencies, make sure you have the following:

- **Node.js:** Version 18 or later
- **npm:** Version 8 or later (included with Node.js)
- **Code editor**: I recommend [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

### Steps

1. First, run `npm i` to install the dependencies.
2. Run the development server: `npm run dev`
3. Open [localhost:3000](http:localhost:3000)

## Customization

1. Modify `globals.css` file to change the template's colors.
2. Personalize `siteDetails.ts` file inside the `/src/data` folder to change site related information.
3. Modify the rest of the files inside the `/src/data` folder to change data such as navigation links, features, pricing, testimonials, faq, and others.
4. Replace the favicon.ico file inside the `/src/app` folder to use your own icon.
5. Add your images to the `public/images` for the open graph social metadata (e.g. og-image.jpg, twitter-image.jpg).
6. Deploy on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) or alternative hosts or platforms.

## Deploying on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/) from the creators of Next.js.
